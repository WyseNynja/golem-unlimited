# Golem Unlimited

Golem is a network of heterogeneous computing resources where each resource may be represented by either a single machine or a more complex component, such as a whole subnetwork in a data-center like setting.

Golem Unlimited is a framework used to manage such setups, and it features the [hub](gu-hub) acting as a requestor and additional worker nodes in the hubâ€™s trusted network acting as [providers](gu-provider).

It is meant for data center-like setup (render farms, or desktops within organization LAN) where network participants trust each other. This assumption allows simplifying the design and taking care of only the computation layer. Other components such as economic layers, reputation systems, verification algorithms, and sandboxing (in contrast to the public Golem Network) can be skipped altogether or implemented optionally.

Golem Unlimited is a part of the broader [Golem](../../../golem) ecosystem. The hub will be able to expose the whole subnetwork by acting as a Golem Network provider and earn GNTs.

# Use cases
So far we have prepared plugins for two use cases:
* Integer factorization
* Mining 

We will open source those plugins soon.

# Installing and testing

Please bear in mind that Golem Unlimited is in its [Alpha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle#Alpha) stage.

## binary
To install you can use the [released](../../releases) Ubuntu `deb` and MacOs `dmg` binary packages.

The detailed steps can be found in our demo https://youtu.be/J0LBdg2j6Tk

## from source
To run the hub, go to the `gu-hub` subdir and perform
```
$ cargo run -- -vv server run
```

To run the provider and connect to your hub at 192.168.1.1 go to `gu-provider` subdir and run
```
$ cargo run -- -vv -a 192.168.1.1:61622 server run
```
